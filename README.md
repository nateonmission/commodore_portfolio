### Description
```
My prject is the foundation of a portfolio website.  It includes **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and custom **CSS**. 
- Since my first computer was a Commodore 64, I gave the main page the apperance of the C64 boot screen.  It presents skill catagories that provide pop-ups with details when clicked.  The C64 screen colapses to an expandable unordered list on small screens.  
- The gallery page demonstrates flex-box and a few hover and click effects.
- The portfolio page contains some additional JavaScript widgets.
